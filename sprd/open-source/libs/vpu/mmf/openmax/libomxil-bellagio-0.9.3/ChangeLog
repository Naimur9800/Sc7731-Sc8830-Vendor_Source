Changes in 0.9.3:
- Added support for dynamic loading of components
Changes in 0.9.2.1:
- Added optional support to components quality levels
  The global setting of quality level for a component has been added.
  Optionally a component can provide support for Set/GetQualityLevel functions.
  These functions will globally set a group of Parameters that 
  represents a certain quality level. If this setting causes a change
  in any output port parameter the PortSettingsChange event is generated.
  The quality levels allow the IL Client to handle the resource usage of 
  components given a quality of service policy.
  This change is not part of the OpenMAX standard and it is an optional
  feature of the Bellagio components. The old components are still
  compatible with new version of Bellagio.

Changes in 0.9.2:
- Moved all the components in a separate package.
  The actual version contains only few reference
  components that do not depend from any external library
- Added an internal abstract resource manager to
  emulate the correct behavior for WaitForResources status
- Removed all the symbian support
- added an error return to the queuing functions

Changes in 0.9.1:
Added omx_base_image_port base class
Added symbian support skipped in the last delivery
Added a jpeg encoder/decoder component
Added some tests

Changes in 0.9.0:
The main additions to this delivery are:

 - The symbian version of bellagio with a new component loader, 
   several components and all the needed infrastructure has been added
 - Audio video synchronization support, with the addition of 
   a new Clock component
 - Enhancement in the build system
 - New naming for the bellagio library. Now it is named libomxil-bellagio


Changes in 0.3.4:
added several components: 
 - audio source based on alsa
 - audiomixer: simpel mixer with constant rate
 - 3gp audio/video parser based on ffmpeg
 - video source based on Video4Linux
Added new domain specific base ports
 
Difference 0.3.2 -> 0.3.3:
- Added AAC format to the audio decoder based on ffmpeg
- The all makefile system has been updated
  - It is possible to compile from a different directory
- Added a directory for all the common functionalities of the tests
- Updated OpenMAX header files to the 1.1.1 version
- Added simple support to UseEGLImage function (video color converter component)
- Updated component loader interface:
  - added the function DestroyComponent
  - changed the loader self reference
- Added port construction function pointer
- Removed CHECK_ERROR and CHECK_HEADER macros
- Added optional installation of Bellagio internal header files for new 
  components development outside Bellagio source tree. configure option --enable-install-devel

WARNING! the version of ffmpeg used has been changed, since the AAC is supported 
only by the most recent version of ffmpeg, 0.4.9-0.37.20070503


Difference 0.3.1 -> 0.3.2:
- Some bug fixed
- improved code style
- added SetHeader functionality for many parameters
- removed destructor from function pointers exposed to ST static loader
- removed empty functions from final components
- removed unnecessary library dependencies
- enhanced test applications
