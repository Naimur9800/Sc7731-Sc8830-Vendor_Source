The OpenMAX IL Bellagio package ver. 0.9.2.1 has been released. 
The main additions to this delivery are:
	- An optional support to components quality levels has been added.
  The global setting of quality level for a component has been added.
  Optionally a component can provide support for Set/GetQualityLevel functions.
  These functions will globally set a group of Parameters that 
  represents a certain quality level. If this setting causes a change
  in any output port parameter the PortSettingsChange event is generated.
  The quality levels allow the IL Client to handle the resource usage of 
  components given a quality of service policy.
  This change is not part of the OpenMAX standard and it is an optional
  feature of the Bellagio components. The old components are still
  compatible with new version of Bellagio.
