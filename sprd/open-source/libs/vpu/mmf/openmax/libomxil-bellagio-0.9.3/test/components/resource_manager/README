OMXRMTEST
omxrmtest OMX_name [-i max_comp]
This test allocates and puts to idle n istances of OMX_name component.
n can be max_comp or an internal default value of 5
If the maximum number of instances of the compoentn is less that n the last component 
that went to idle is put into wait for resources state. If the system works the component 
that fails to go to Ilde will be automatically put in Idle.

This test is succesful when the execution is completed.
If the resource management is tested a string will notify it.

OMXPRIORITYTEST
omxprioritytest OMX_name [-i max_comp]
This test is similar to the first one. In this case the last good component is not switched back to loaded,
but the first failing component is provided with an higher priority so that one of the other components
are pre-empted by the resource manager.
