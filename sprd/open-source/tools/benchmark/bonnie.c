/*
 * This is a file system benchmark which attempts to study bottlenecks -
 * it is named 'Bonnie' for semi-obvious reasons.
 *
 * Specifically, these are the types of filesystem activity that have been
 * observed to be bottlenecks in I/O-intensive applications, in particular
 * the text database work done in connection with the New Oxford English
 * Dictionary Project at the University of Waterloo.
 * 
 * It performs a series of tests on a file of known size.  By default, that
 * size is 100 Mb (but that's not enough - see below).  For each test, Bonnie 
 * reports the bytes processed per elapsed second, per CPU second, and the 
 * % CPU usage (user and system).
 * 
 * In each case, an attempt is made to keep optimizers from noticing it's 
 * all bogus.  The idea is to make sure that these are real transfers to/from
 * user space to the physical disk.  The tests are:
 * 
 * 1. Sequential Output
 * 
 * 1.1 Per-Character.  The file is written using the putc() stdio macro.
 * The loop that does the writing should be small enough to fit into any
 * reasonable I-cache.  The CPU overhead here is that required to do the
 * stdio code plus the OS file space allocation.
 * 
 * 1.2 Block.  The file is created using write(2).  The CPU overhead
 * should be just the OS file space allocation.
 * 
 * 1.3 Rewrite.  Each BUFSIZ of the file is read with read(2), dirtied, and
 * rewritten with write(2), requiring an lseek(2).  Since no space
 * allocation is done, and the I/O is well-localized, this should test the
 * effectiveness of the filesystem cache and the speed of data transfer.
 * 
 * 2. Sequential Input
 * 
 * 2.1 Per-Character.  The file is read using the getc() stdio macro.  Once
 * again, the inner loop is small.  This should exercise only stdio and
 * sequential input.
 * 
 * 2.2 Block.  The file is read using read(2).  This should be a very pure
 * test of sequential input performance.
 * 
 * 3. Random Seeks
 * 
 * This test runs SeekProcCount processes in parallel, doing a total of
 * 4000 lseek()s to locations in the file specified by random() in bsd systems,
 * drand48() on sysV systems.  In each case, the block is read with read(2).  
 * In 10% of cases, it is dirtied and written back with write(2).
 *
 * The idea behind the SeekProcCount processes is to make sure there's always 
 * a seek queued up.
 * 
 * AXIOM: For any unix filesystem, the effective number of lseek(2) calls
 * per second declines asymptotically to near 30, once the effect of
 * caching is defeated.
 * 
 * The size of the file has a strong nonlinear effect on the results of
 * this test.  Many Unix systems that have the memory available will make
 * aggressive efforts to cache the whole thing, and report random I/O rates
 * in the thousands per second, which is ridiculous.  As an extreme
 * example, an IBM RISC 6000 with 64 Mb of memory reported 3,722 per second
 * on a 50 Mb file.  Some have argued that bypassing the cache is artificial
 * since the cache is just doing what it's designed to.  True, but in any 
 * application that requires rapid random access to file(s) significantly
 * larger than main memory which is running on a system which is doing
 * significant other work, the caches will inevitably max out.  There is
 * a hard limit hiding behind the cache which has been observed by the
 * author to be of significant import in many situations - what we are trying
 * to do here is measure that number.
