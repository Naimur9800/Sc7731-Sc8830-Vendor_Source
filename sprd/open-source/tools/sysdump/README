How to use sysdump with crash tool
	1. while panic or deadlock occurs, sysdump will save error info automaticly
           onto TF-card, it will take a while. You can see some info from serial
	   console.
	2. after saving error info, the system will start, then the error info file
	   can be get in TF-card, file names are "sysdump_122.399770_.core.00" partern.
	   "122.399770" is system start up time in kernel, ".00"  is order number.
	3. use the following command in linux to composite these files into one core
           dump file named "sysdump.core".
	   ls | grep -E 'sysdump_[0-9.]+_.core.[0-9]{2}' | sort | while read line; do cat $line >> sysdump.core; done
	4. ./crash --no_modules vmlinux sysdump.core
	   notice that "vmlinux" is the vmlinux compiled with debugging info.

How to use sysdump with gdb

	1-3 steps is as above

	4. use gdb from toolchain to open the core dump file, like
	   prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi-gdb vmlinux --core sysdump.core
	   notice that "vmlinux" is the vmlinux compiled with debugging info.


This directory contains little tools for sysdump.

	1.  ".gdbinit" is a gdb script that for analyze sysdump,
		put is in $HOME/ or $PWD/
	2.  "corebt" is a executable file for showing backtrace of
	    	cpu and process, that can't be done in gdb scritp.
	    	it runs on x86, make sure arm-eabi-gdb is in $PATH.
	3.  "corebt.c" is source code for corebt, just to type
		"make corebt" to generate corebt executable.
	4.  "CortexA5MP2_attach.cmm" is a script for Trace32 to
		attach Tiger phone.
	5.  "elfcompare" is a executable file for showing the text section difference
		between the vmlinux and the core file
	6.  "elfcompare.c" is source code for elfcompare, this is the version 1;
	7.  "crash" compiled bin of crash tool
