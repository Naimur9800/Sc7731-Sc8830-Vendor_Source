1) SV mask handling
-------------------

provided patch file: v40x_almephmask.patch
 applies to project: frameworks/base
     affected files: location/java/android/location/GpsStatus.java
                     services/java/com/android/server/location/GpsLocationProvider.java

This patch fixes the 32bit SV mask handling to adapt to GLONASS and SBAS SV ids
(PRNs). This is optional and does not affect performance.


2) u-blox GPS setup
-------------------

provided patch file: v40x_ubx_gps_setup.patch
 applies to project: device/ti/panda
     affected files: device.mk
                     fstab.omap4pandaboard
                     init.omap4pandaboard.rc
                     ubx-setup.sh 

Adds a ubx-setup.sh script, launched at boot, that sets up networkin on eth0
and asserts correct permissions on the UART.

This is mainly for internal development and should be adopted to the particular
setup in use.


3) development tools
--------------------

provided patch file: v40x_development.patch (and local_manifest.xml)
 applies to project: device/ti/panda
     affected files: full_panda.mk

This adds libncurses, busybox and bash packages to the build. Requires the
supplied local_manifest.xml installed in the .repo directory.
