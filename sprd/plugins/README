The folder of packages is cloned from platform/packages, but it is only one git repository in vendor/sprd/plugins/.git

===============================
Intial plugin
===============================
1. You can intialize your addon into the packages/apps/YourModules/addons/AddonName
2. Use "include $(BUILD_ADDON_PACKAGE)" instead of $(BUILD_PACKAGE) in Android.mk
3. We suggest you initial your addon in a dependency way, build your full Android.mk and AndroidManifest.xml for fast debugging and feature change in future.

===============================
Combine plugins into one
===============================
1. The combined package is the final package included into build system
2. You may use the demo as follow to create a combined module

LOCAL_PATH := $(call my-dir)
src_dirs := ../Mms/addons/Drm/src \
            ../FileExplorer/addons/Drm/src \
            ../Gallery2/addons/Drm/src
            <the path from current>/<Package>/addons/<Module>/src

res_dirs := ../Mms/addons/Drm/res \
            ../FileExplorer/addons/Drm/res \
            ../Gallery2/addons/Drm/res
            <the path from current>/<Package>/addons/<Module>/res

# This flag must be added to avoid build error
LOCAL_AAPT_FLAGS := \
    --auto-add-overlay

LOCAL_SRC_FILES := $(call all-java-files-under,$(src_dirs))

LOCAL_RES_DIR := $(addprefix $(LOCAL_PATH)/, $(res_dirs))

LOCAL_PACKAGE_NAME := DrmAddon

# Warning, please use the BUILD_ADDON_PACKAGE instead of BUILD_PACKAGE when building the addon
include $(BUILD_ADDON_PACKAGE)
include $(call all-makefiles-under,$(LOCAL_PATH))
