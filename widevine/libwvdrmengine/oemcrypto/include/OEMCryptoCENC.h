/*
 * OEMCrypto_DestBufferDesc
 *  Describes the type and access information for the memory to receive
 *  decrypted data.
 *
 *  The OEMCrypto API supports a range of client device architectures.
 *  Different architectures have different methods for acquiring and securing
 *  buffers that will hold portions of the audio or video stream after
 *  decryption.  Three basic strategies are recognized for handling decrypted
 *  stream data:
 *  1. Return the decrypted data in the clear into normal user memory
 *     (ClearBuffer). The caller uses normal memory allocation methods to
 *     acquire a buffer, and supplies the memory address of the buffer in the
 *     descriptor.
 *  2. Place the decrypted data into protected memory (SecureBuffer).  The
 *     caller uses a platform-specific method to acquire the protected buffer
 *     and a user-memory handle that references it.  The handle is supplied
 *     to the decrypt call in the descriptor.
 *  3. Place the decrypted data directly into the audio or video decoder fifo
 *     (Direct). The caller will use platform-specific methods to initialize
 *     the fifo and the decoders.  The decrypted stream data is not accessible
 *     to the caller.
 *
 *  Specific fields are as follows:
 *
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Clear)
 *      address - Address of start of user memory buffer.
 *      max_length - Size of user memory buffer.
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Secure)
 *      buffer - handle to a platform-specific secure buffer.
 *      max_length - Size of platform-specific secure buffer.
 *  (type == OEMCrypto_BufferType_Direct)
 *      is_video - If true, decrypted bytes are routed to the video
 *                 decoder.  If false, decrypted bytes are routed to the
 *                 audio decoder.

 *
 *   Refer to document "Widevine Modular DRM Security Integration Guide for

 *   These three keys will be stored until the next call to LoadKeys.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - handle for the session to be used.
 *   mac_key_context (in) - pointer to memory containing context data for
 *                          computing the HMAC generation key.
 *   mac_key_context_length (in) - length of the HMAC key context data, in bytes.

 *
 *   Because the nonce will be used to prevent replay attacks, it is desirable

 *
 * Parameters:

 *   to OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys().  The nonce was generated and stored by
 *   the previous call to OEMCrypto_GenerateNonce().
 *
 *   This session’s elapsed time clock is started at 0.  The clock will be used
 *   in OEMCrypto_DecryptCTR().
 *
 *   NOTE: OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys() must be called first to establish the
 *   mac_key and encrypt_key.
 *
 *   Refer to document "Widevine Modular DRM Security Integration Guide for
 *   CENC" for details.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed.  If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned, and none of the keys are loaded.
 *
 *   1. The signature of the message shall be computed, and the API shall verify
 *   the computed signature matches the signature passed in.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE.  The signature verification shall use a
 *   constant-time algorithm (a signature mismatch will always take the same time
 *   as a successful comparison).
 *
 *   2. The enc_mac_keys pointer must be either null, or point inside the
 *   message. If the pointer enc_mac_keys is not null, [e]the API shall verify
 *   that the two pointers enc_mac_keys_iv and enc_mac_keys point to locations in
 *   the message.  I.e.  (message <= p && p < message+message_length)for p in
 *   each of enc_mac_keys_iv, enc_mac_keys. If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   3. The API shall verify that each pointer in each KeyObject points to a
 *   location in the message.  I.e.  (message <= p && p < message+message_length)
 *   for p in each of key_id, key_data_iv, key_data, key_control_iv,
 *   key_control. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   4. Each key’s control block, after decryption, shall have a valid
 *   verification field. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   5. If any key control block has the Nonce_Enabled bit set, that key’s Nonce
 *   field shall match the nonce generated by the current nonce.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE.  If there is a match, remove that nonce from
 *   the cache.  Note that all the key control blocks in a particular call shall
 *   have the same nonce value.
 *
 *   6. If the key control block has a nonzero Replay_Control, then the
 *   verification described below is also performed.
 *
 *   Usage Table and Provider Session Token (pst):
 *
 *   If a key control block has a nonzero value for Replay_Control, then all keys
 *   in this license will have the same value.  In this case, the following
 *   additional checks are performed.
 *
 *   The pointer pst must not be null, and must point to a location in the
 *   message.  If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   - If Replay_Control is 1 = Nonce_Required, then OEMCrypto will perform a
 *     nonce check as described above.   OEMCrypto will verify that the table does
 *     not already have an entry for the value of pst passed in as a parameter ---
 *     if an entry already exists, an error OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT is
 *     returned and no keys are loaded.  OEMCrypto will then create a new entry in
 *     the table, and mark this session as using this new entry.  This prevents the
 *     license from being loaded more than once, and will be used for online
 *     streaming.
 *
 *   - If Replay_Control is 2 = “Require existing Session Usage table entry or
 *     Nonce”,  then OEMCrypto will check the Session Usage table for an existing
 *     entry with the same pst.
 *
 *   --- If the pst is not in the table yet, a new entry will be created in the
 *       table and this session shall use the new entry. In that case, the nonce
 *       will be verified for each key.
 *
 *   --- If an existing usage table entry is found, then this session will use
 *       that entry.  In that case, the nonce will not be verified for each key.
 *       Also, the entry’s mac keys will be verified against the current
 *       session’s mac keys.  This allows an offline license to be reloaded but
 *       maintain continuity of the playback times from one session to the next.
 *
 *   - If the nonce is not valid and an existing entry is not found, the return
 *     error is OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE.
 *
 *   Note: If LoadKeys updates the mac keys, then the new updated mac keys will
 *   be used in the Usage Table.  If LoadKeys does not update the mac keys, the
 *   existing session mac keys are stored in the usage table.
 *
 *   Sessions that are associated with an entry will need to be able to update
 *   and verify the status of the entry, and the time stamps in the entry.
 *
 *   Devices that do not support the Usage Table will return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT if the Replay_Control is nonzero.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.
 *   message (in) - pointer to memory containing message to be verified.
 *   message_length (in) - length of the message, in bytes.
 *   signature (in) - pointer to memory containing the signature.

 *                       512 bits.
 *   num_keys (in) - number of keys present.
 *   key_array (in) - set of keys to be installed.
 *   pst (in) - the Provider Session Token.
 *   pst_length (in) - the length of pst.
 *
 * Threading:
 *   This function may be called simultaneously with functions on other sessions,
 *   but not with other functions on this session.
 *
 * Returns:

 * OEMCrypto_RefreshKeys
 *
 * Description:
 *   Updates an existing set of keys for continuing decryption in the

 *
 *   The relevant fields have been extracted from the Renewal Response protocol
 *   message, but the entire message and associated signature are provided so the
 *   message can be verified (using HMAC-SHA256 with the current
 *   mac_key[server]). If any verification step fails, an error is returned.
 *   Otherwise, the key table in trusted memory is updated using the key_control
 *   block. When updating an entry in the table, only the duration, nonce, and
 *   nonce_enabled fields are used.  All other key control bits are not modified.
 *
 *   NOTE: OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys() or OEMCrypto_LoadKeys() must be called
 *   first to establish the mac_key[server].
 *
 *   This session’s elapsed time clock is reset to 0 when this function is called.
 *   The elapsed time clock is used in OEMCrypto_DecryptCTR().
 *
 *   This function does not add keys to the key table.  It is only used to update a
 *   key control block license duration. Refer to the License Signing and
 *   Verification section above for more details.  This function is used to update
 *   the duration of a key, only.  It is not used to update key control bits.
 *
 *   If the KeyRefreshObject’s key_control_iv is null, then the key_control is not
 *   encrypted.  If the key_control_iv is specified, then key_control is encrypted
 *   with the first 128 bits of the corresponding content key.
 *
 *   If the KeyRefreshObject’s key_id is null, then this refresh object should be
 *   used to update the duration of all keys for the current session.  In this
 *   case, key_control_iv will also be null and the control block will not be
 *   encrypted.
 *
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed.  If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned, and none of the keys are loaded.
 *
 *   1. The signature of the message shall be computed, and the API shall verify
 *   the computed signature matches the signature passed in.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE. The signature verification shall use a
 *   constant-time algorithm (a signature mismatch will always take the same time
 *   as a successful comparison).
 *
 *   2. The API shall verify that each pointer in each KeyObject points to a
 *   location in the message, or is null.  I.e.  (message <= p && p <
 *   message+message_length) for p in each of key_id,key_control_iv,
 *   key_control. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   3. Each key’s control block shall have a valid verification field. If not,
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_CONTEXT.
 *
 *   4. If the key control block has the Nonce_Enabled bit set, the Nonce field
 *   shall match one of the nonces in the cache.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE. If there is a match, remove that nonce from the
 *   cache.   Note that all the key control blocks in a particular call shall have
 *   the same nonce value.

/*
 * OEMCrypto_DecryptCTR
 *
 * Description:
 *   Decrypts (AES-128-CTR) or copies the payload in the buffer referenced by the
 *   data_addr parameter into the buffer referenced by the out_buffer parameter,
 *   using the session context indicated by the session parameter.  If is_encrypted
 *   is true, the content key associated with the session is latched in the active
 *   hardware key ladder and is used for the decryption operation.  If is_encrypted
 *   is false, the data is simply copied.
 *
 *   After decryption, the data_length bytes are copied to the location described
 *   by out_buffer.  This could be one of
 *
 *   1. The structure out_buffer contains a pointer to a clear text buffer.  The
 *   OEMCrypto library shall verify that key control allows data to be returned in
 *   clear text.  If it is not authorized, this method should return an error.
 *
 *   2. The structure out_buffer contains a handle to a secure buffer.
 *
 *   3. The structure out_buffer indicates that the data should be sent directly to
 *   the decoder and rendered.
 *
 * NOTES:
 *   IV points to the counter value to be used for the initial
 *   encrypted block of the input buffer. The IV length is the AES
 *   block size. For subsequent encrypted AES blocks the IV is
 *   calculated by incrementing the lower 64 bits (byte 8-15) of the
 *   IV value used for the previous block. The counter rolls over to
 *   zero when it reaches its maximum value (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF).
 *   The upper 64 bits (byte 0-7) of the IV do not change.
 *
 *   This method may be called several times before the decrypted data is used.
 *   For this reason, the parameter subsample_flags may be used to optimize
 *   decryption.  The first buffer in a chunk of data will have the
 *   OEMCrypto_FirstSubsample bit set in subsample_flags.  The last buffer in a
 *   chunk of data will have the OEMCrypto_LastSubsample bit set in
 *   subsample_flags.  The decrypted data will not be used until after
 *   OEMCrypto_LastSubsample has been set.  If an implementation decrypts data
 *   immediately, it may ignore subsample_flags.
 *
 *   If the destination buffer is secure, an offset may be specified.  DecryptCTR
 *   begins storing data out_buffer->secure.offset bytes after the beginning of the
 *   secure buffer.
 *
 *   If the session has an entry in the Usage Table, then OEMCrypto will update the
 *   time_of_last_decrypt.  If the status of the entry is “unused”, then change the
 *   status to “active” and set the time_of_first_decrypt.[f]
 *
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed if is_encrypted is true.  If any
 *   check fails, an error is returned, and no decryption is performed.
 *
 *   1. If the current key’s control block has a nonzero Duration field, then the
 *   API shall verify that the duration is greater than the session’s elapsed time
 *   clock. If not, return OEMCrypto_ERROR_KEY_EXPIRED[g].
 *
 *   2. If the current key’s control block has the Data_Path_Type bit set, then the
 *   API shall verify that the output buffer is secure or direct.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_DECRYPT_FAILED.
 *
 *   3. If the current key’s control block has the HDCP bit set, then the API shall
 *   verify that the buffer will be output using HDCP only.  If not, return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_DECRYPT_FAILED.
 *
 *   4. If the current key’s control block has a nonzero value for HDCP_Version,
 *   then the current version of HDCP for the device and the display combined will
 *   be compared against the version specified in the control block.  If the
 *   current version is not at least as high as that in the control block, then
 *   return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_HDCP.
 *
 *   1. If the current session has an entry in the Usage Table, and the status of
 *   that entry is “inactive”, then return OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_SESSION.[h]
 *
 *   If the flag is_encrypted is false, then no verification is performed.  This
 *   call shall copy clear data even when there are no keys loaded, or there is no
 *   selected key.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - crypto session identifier.
 *   data_addr (in) - An unaligned pointer to this segment of the stream.
 *   data_length (in) - The length of this segment of the stream, in bytes.
 *   is_encrypted (in) - True if the buffer described by data_addr, data_length is
 *                       encrypted.  If is_encrypted is false, only the data_addr
 *                       and data_length parameters are used. The iv and offset
 *                       arguments are ignored.
 *   iv (in) - The initial value block to be used for content decryption.
 *   block_offset (in) - If non-zero, the decryption block boundary is different
 *                       from the start of the data. block_offset should be
 *                       subtracted from data_addr to compute the starting address
 *                       of the first decrypted block. The bytes between the
 *                       decryption block start address and data_addr are discarded
 *                       after decryption. It does not adjust the beginning of the
 *                       source or destination data.  This parameter satisfies
 *                       0 <= block_offset < 16.
 *   out_buffer (in) - A caller-owned descriptor that specifies the handling of the
 *                     decrypted byte stream. See OEMCrypto_DestbufferDesc for details.
 *   subsample_flags (in) - bitwise flags indicating if this is the first, middle,
 *                          or last subsample in a chunk of data.
 *      1 = first subsample,
 *      2 = last subsample,
 *      3 = both first and last subsample,
 *      0 = neither first nor last subsample.

 * OEMCrypto_WrapKeybox
 *
 * Description:
 *   During manufacturing, the keybox should be encrypted with the OEM root key and
 *   stored on the file system in a region that will not be erased during factory
 *   reset.   As described in section 5.5.4, the keybox may be directly encrypted
 *   and stored on the device in a single step, or it may use the two-step
 *   WrapKeybox/InstallKeybox approach.  When the Widevine DRM plugin initializes,
 *   it will look for a wrapped keybox in the file /factory/wv.keys and install it
 *   into the security processor by calling OEMCrypto_InstallKeybox().
 *
 *   OEMCrypto_WrapKeybox() is used to generate an OEM-encrypted keybox that may be
 *   passed to OEMCrypto_InstallKeybox() for provisioning.  The keybox may be
 *   either passed in the clear or previously encrypted with a transport key.  If a
 *   transport key is supplied, the keybox is first decrypted with the transport
 *   key before being wrapped with the OEM root key.  This function is only needed
 *   if the provisioning method involves saving the keybox to the file system.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   keybox   (in) - pointer to Keybox data to encrypt.  May be NULL on the first
 *                  call to test size of wrapped keybox. The keybox may either be clear or
 *                  previously encrypted.
 *   keyboxLength  (in) - length the keybox data in bytes
 *   wrappedKeybox   (out) – Pointer to wrapped keybox
 *   wrappedKeyboxLength  (out) – Pointer to the length of the wrapped keybox in bytes
 *   transportKey  (in) – Optional. AES transport key.  If provided, the keybox
 *                       parameter was previously encrypted with this key.  The keybox will be
 *                       decrypted with the transport key using AES-CBC and a null IV.
 *   transportKeyLength (in) – Optional. Number of bytes in the transportKey, if used.

/*
 * OEMCrypto_RewrapDeviceRSAKey
 *
 * Description:
 *   Verifies an RSA provisioning response is valid and corresponds to the previous
 *   provisioning request by checking the nonce.  The RSA private key is decrypted
 *   and stored in secure memory.  The RSA key is then re-encrypted and signed for
 *   storage on the filesystem.  We recommend that the OEM use an encryption key
 *   and signing key generated using an algorithm at least as strong as that in
 *   GenerateDerivedKeys.
 *
 *   After decrypting enc_rsa_key, If the first four bytes of the buffer are the
 *   string “SIGN”, then the actual RSA key begins on the 9th byte of the buffer.
 *   The second four bytes of the buffer is the 32 bit field “allowed_schemes”,
 *   of type RSA_Padding_Scheme, which is used in OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature.    The
 *   value of allowed_schemes must also be wrapped with RSA key. We recommend
 *   storing the magic string “SIGN” with the key to distinguish keys that have a
 *   value for allowed_schemes from those that should use the default
 *   allowed_schemes. Devices that do not support the alternative signing
 *   algorithms may refuse to load these keys and return an error of
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.  The main use case for these alternative
 *   signing algorithms is to support devices that use x509 certificates for
 *   authentication when acting as a ChromeCast receiver.  This is not needed for
 *   devices that wish to send data to a ChromeCast.
 *
 *   If the first four bytes of the buffer enc_rsa_key are not the string “SIGN”,
 *   then the default value of allowed_schemes = 1 will be used.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The following checks should be performed.  If any check fails, an error is
 *   returned, and the key is not loaded.
 *   1. Check that all the pointer values passed into it are within the buffer
 *   specified by message and message_length.
 *   2. Verify that in_wrapped_rsa_key_length is large enough to hold the rewrapped
 *   key, returning OEMCRYPTO_ERROR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL otherwise.
 *   3. Verify that the nonce matches one generated by a previous call to
 *   OEMCrypto_GenerateNonce().  The matching nonce shall be removed from the nonce
 *   table.  If there is no matching nonce, return OEMCRYPTO_ERROR_INVALID_NONCE.
 *   4. Verify the message signature, using the derived signing key
 *   (mac_key[server]).
 *   5. Decrypt enc_rsa_key using the derived encryption key (enc_key), and
 *   enc_rsa_key_iv.
 *   6. Validate the decrypted RSA device key by verifying that it can be loaded by
 *   the RSA implementation.
 *   7. Generate a random initialization vector and store it in
 *   wrapped_rsa_key_iv.
 *   8. Re-encrypt the device RSA key with an internal key (such as the OEM key or
 *   Widevine Keybox key) and the generated IV using AES-128-CBC with PKCS#5
 *   padding.
 *   9. Copy the rewrapped key to the buffer specified by wrapped_rsa_key and the
 *   size of the wrapped key to wrapped_rsa_key_length.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in)            - crypto session identifier.

/*
 * OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature
 *
 * Description:
 *   The OEMCrypto_GenerateRSASignature method is used to sign messages using the
 *   device private RSA key, specifically, it is used to sign the initial license
 *   request. Refer to the License Request Signed by RSA Certificate section above
 *   for more details.
 *
 *   For devices that wish to be CAST receivers, there is a new RSA padding scheme.
 *   The padding_scheme parameter indicates which hashing and padding is to be
 *   applied to the message so as to generate the encoded message (the
 *   modulus-sized block to which the integer conversion and RSA decryption is
 *   applied). The following values are defined:
 *   0x1 - RSASSA-PSS with SHA1.
 *   0x2 - PKCS1 with block type 1 padding (only).
 *
 *   In the first case, a hash algorithm (SHA1) is first applied to the message,
 *   whose length is not otherwise restricted. In the second case, the "message" is
 *   already a digest, so no further hashing is applied, and the message_length can
 *   be no longer than 83 bytes.  If the message_length is greater than 83 bytes
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_SIGNATURE_FAILURE shall be returned.
 *
 *   The second padding scheme is for devices that use x509 certificates for
 *   authentication. The main example is devices that work as a Cast receiver, like
 *   a ChromeCast, not for devices that wish to send to the Cast device, such as
 *   almost all Android devices.  OEMs that do not support x509 certificate
 *   authentication need not implement the second scheme and can return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   The bitwise AND of the parameter padding_scheme and the RSA key’s
 *   allowed_schemes is computed.  If this value is 0, then the signature is not
 *   computed and the error OEMCrypto_ERROR_INVALID_RSA_KEY is returned.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in)              - crypto session identifier.
 *   message (in)              - pointer to memory containing message to be
 *                             - signed.
 *   message_length (in)       - length of the message, in bytes.
 *   signature (out)           - buffer to hold the message signature. On
 *                             - return, it will contain the message signature
 *                             - generated with the device private RSA key using
 *                             - RSASSA-PSS.
 *   signature_length (in/out) - (in) length of the signature buffer, in bytes.
 *                             - (out) actual length of the signature
 *   padding_scheme (in) - specify which scheme to use for the signature.

 *
 *   This function is similar to OEMCrypto_GenerateDerivedKeys, except that it

 *   requests using RSA or using a Widevine keybox token.
 *
 * Verification:
 *   If the RSA key’s allowed_schemes is not kSign_RSASSA_PSS, then no keys are

 *
 *   OEMCrypto will increment Usage Table’s generation number, sign, encrypt, and
 *   save the Usage Table.  This is done, even though the table has not changed, so
 *   that a single rollback cannot undo a call to DeactivateUsageEntry and still
 *   report that license as inactive.
 *
 *   The pst_report is filled out by subtracting the times un the Usage Table from
 *   the current time on the secure clock.  This is done in case the secure clock
 *   is not using UTC time, but is instead using something like seconds since clock
 *   installed.
 *
 *   Valid values for status are:
 *     0 = kUnused -- the keys have not been used to decrypt.
 *     1 = kActive -- the keys have been used, and have not been deactivated.
 *     2 = kInactive -- the keys have been marked inactive.
 *
 *   The clock_security_level is reported as follows:
 *     0 = Insecure Clock - clock just uses system time.
 *     1 = Secure Timer - clock uses secure timer, which cannot be modified by user
 *     software, when OEMCrypto is active and the system time when OEMCrypto is
 *     inactive.
 *     2 = Software Secure Clock - clock cannot be modified by user software when
 *     OEMCrypto is active or inactive.
 *     3 = Hardware Secure Clock - clock cannot be modified by user software and
 *     there are security features that prevent the user from modifying the clock
 *     in hardware, such as a tamper proof battery.
 *
 *   After pst_report has been filled in, the HMAC SHA1 signature is computed for
 *   the buffer from bytes 20 to the end of the pst field.  The signature is
 *   computed using the client_mac_key which is stored in the usage table.  The
 *   HMAC SHA1 signature is used to prevent a rogue application from using
 *   OMECrypto_GenerateSignature to forge a Usage Report.
 *
 *   This function also copies the client_mac_key and server_mac_key from the Usage
 *   Table entry to the session.  They will be used to verify a signature in
 *   OEMCrypto_DeleteUsageEntry below.  This session will be associated with the
 *   entry in the Usage Table.
 *
 *   Devices that do not implement a Session Usage Table may return
 *   OEMCrypto_ERROR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED.
 *
 * Parameters:
 *   session (in) - handle for the session to be used.
