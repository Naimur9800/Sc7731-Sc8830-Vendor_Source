Description:
Google's framework for writing and using C++ mock classes on a variety of
platforms (Linux, Mac OS X, Windows, Windows CE, Symbian, etc). Inspired by
jMock, EasyMock, and Hamcrest, and designed with C++'s specifics in mind, it can
help you derive better designs of your system and write better tests.

While gMock supports building with the Android NDK out-of-the-box, it needs some
small modifications to build as part of the Android OS build.  Specifically, it
needs a different format of build script, and it needs to build against the OS'
modified version of gTest, rather than the packaged version.

Local Modifications:
--Tue Jun 3, 2014 (joeyparrish)--

Removed DOS newlines for the sake of the git-to-piper bridge.  Piper converts
newlines automatically to unix style.  If this change is not made in git, the
bridge detects differences and attempts to sync to piper, even when nothing
has changed in git.

--Mon Feb 4, 2014 (juce)--

Upgraded to gMock 1.7.0.  This is required for compatibility with the upgrade
of gTest on Android Master to 1.7.0.  Note that after this change, this code
will no longer work on Android KLP branches.  Our gMock must match the version
of gTest in the Android tree.

Updated src/Android.mk to turn on the gTest replacement for std::tr1::tuple.
On Android, gTest builds without using the platform's std::tr1::tuple (which
does not exist on Android) and without gTest's implementation of a subset of
std::tr1::tuple.  This works on Android because it omits the few features that
rely on std::tr1::tuple.  But gMock was written assuming std::tuple or the
gTest-defined subset would be available, and it cannot be used without one or
the other.

Updated src/Android.mk to account for the new compilers on Android Master.

Removed the unused Host build from src/Android.mk.

Updated the android-rsync-excludes file to reflect the new source and sorted it
alphabetically.

Updated Dr. gMock (which was again omitted from the release) to version 1.7.0.

--Wed Mar 20, 2013 (juce)--

Added the Dr. gMock script, which was missing from the 1.6.0 distribution.

--Mon Mar 4, 2013 (juce)--
